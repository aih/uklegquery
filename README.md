Simple framework for javascript apps, with a minimal flask.py service. Bower for packages, Grunt to compact and compile.

Check out the [demo here](http://aih.github.io/frame)

Basic client-side components include:
*    Bootstrap (css, js)
*    jQuery
*    lodash
*    angularjs

## Getting Started

**Flask Framework**
Install the python Flask framework and its dependencies by following the directions [here](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/installation/#installation).

**Bower Packages**
Bower is a javascript package manager. It requires git, node and NPM. You will want to install those, and then Bower, following the instructions [here](http://bower.io/).

**Grunt build**
Grunt is a task manager for web applications. I'm using it here to concatenate and minify static resources for the app. To run these tasks, (1) install Grunt and the plugins to do these tasks by running from the command line:

```shell
npm install
```

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins.
